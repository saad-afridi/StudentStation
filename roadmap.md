# Things to work on in the next update ~ Early to Mid June (10 - 20):

### Fixes:

-   ~Home typing animation is wonky (starting an alarm in timer makes it always be wonky)~

### Improvement Ideas:

-   ~Course Calculator lets the user know when it's impossible to attain your wanted mark
    (by default just hides it if impossible)~
-   Add Sections to Todos for better organization rather than just a list
-   Clear up the UI For Timer, specifically the pomodoro section
-   Add Instructions on how to use the tools on the home page
-   Create a Logo and Add it to AppBar and Tab

### Code Improvements:

-   ~Move all state management of Timer in App to Redux (reducers, actions, dispatchers)~
-   ~Clean up the file structures (no heirarchy in components)~
-   Connect the app to a Backend rather than storing everything locally
