# Things to work on in the next update (Frontend Finish) ~ Early-Mid June (10-20):

### Fixes:

-   ~Home typing animation is wonky (starting an alarm in timer makes it always be wonky)~
-   ~Calculator can display negative values~

### Improvement Ideas:

-   ~Course Calculator lets the user know when it's impossible to attain your wanted mark
    (by default just hides it if impossible)~
-   Add Sections to Todos for better organization rather than just a list
-   ~Clear up the UI For Timer, specifically the pomodoro section~
-   Add Instructions on how to use the tools on the home page
-   Create/Use a Logo and Add it to AppBar and Tab
-   ~Make the AppBar responsive~
-   ~Add visual to calculator to make it obvious when desired mark is unattainable~
-   Add Priority as an additional parameter for tasks in Todo Lists
-   Be able to create sections in Todo List

### Code Improvements:

-   ~Move all state management of Timer in App to Redux (reducers, actions, dispatchers)~
-   ~Clean up the file structures (no heirarchy in components)~
